# Google-Calendar-Alarm-Clock
The aim of this project is to use the google calendar API to trigger an alarm whenever the current time is the same as when the alarm has been set for. This wake up alarm clock uses a song in a MP3 file format. The song is Attention by charlie puth (you can change it), as this song has high emotional damage when played and will wake me up very fast so I can turn it off. In order to ensure that the person waking up to this alarm is awake enough, it generates a random passcode that the inividual has to type into the tkinter GUI.
